Putative impulses of radio waves are then being applied in order to \"knock these protons out of balance\". This creates short signals (which fade quickly due to subsequent realignment of spins of protons) of different magnitudes, depending on which areas in a given moment contain the most hydrogen (or water/blood, in which it is mostly contained)."

Brain areas, whose activity increases, are being supplied with more oxygenated blood. Since a huge portion of blood is water (and hydrogen atoms in the water are the main direct source of fMRI signal), these areas are seen as more active in fMRI."
